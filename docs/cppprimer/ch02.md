# Variables and Basic Types

## Primitive Built-in Types

C++ primitive types include arithmetic types and a special type named void.

Void type has no associated value and can be used in only a few cases like the return type of a function which does not return any value.

### Arithmetic Types

Arithmetic types include:
* characters
* integers
* boolean values
* floating point numbers

Arithmetic types are divided into integral types (integers, characters and boolean) and floating-point types.

The size of arithmetic types varies across machines. Hence the largest value a type can represent also varies.

Except for bool and the extended character types, the integral types may be signed or unsigned.
* The types short, int, long and long long are all signed.
* Unlike integral types, there are three distinct character types - char, signed char and unsigned char. Char is not the same type as signed char. But there are still only two representations. The (plain) char type follows one of the two representaions depending on the compiler.

Deciding which type to use:
* Use an unsigned type when you know that the numbers cannot be negative.
* Use int for integer arithmentic. If int is smaller than the maximum data value, use long long.
* Do not use plain char or bool in arithmetic expressions. Use them only to hold characters or truth values. Computations using char are especially problematic because char is signed on some machines and unsigned on others. If you need a tiny integer, explicitly specify either signed char or unsigned char. 
* Use double for floating-point computations; float usually does not have enough precision, and the cost of double-precision calculations versus single-precision is negligible. The precision offered by long double usually is unnecessary and often entails considerable run-time cost.

### Type Conversion

Among the operations many types support, there is ability to convert objects of one type to another. It happens automatically when an object of a one type is used where an object of another type is expected.

* If an out of range value is assigned to an unsigned type, the result it the remainder of the value modulo the number of values that type can store.
* If an out of range value is assigned to a signed type, the result is undefined.

*Always avoid Udefined and Implementation-defined Behavior.*

*Don't mix signed and unsigned types.*

### Literals

Every litral has a type. The form and value of a literal determine its type.

**Integer and Floating-point Literals**

* Integral literals can be written using decimal, octal or hexadecimal notation.
* Integers literals that begin with 0 are octal. Intger literals that begin with 0x or 0X are hexadecimal.
* By default, decimal literals are signed whereas octal and hexadecimal literals can be either signed or unsigned types.
* A decimal literal has the smallest type of int, long, or long long in which the literal’s value fits.
* Octal and hexadecimal literals have the smallest type of int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, or unsigned long long in which the literal’s value fits.
* It is an error to use a literal that is too large to fit in the largest related type.
* There are no literals of type short.
* Value of a literal is never negative. For example, in -42, the minus sign is not part of the literal. It is an operator that negates the value of its (literal) operand.
* Floating-point literals include either a decimal point or an exponent specified using scientific notation.

**Character and Character String Literals**

* A character enclosed within single quotes is a character literal.
* Zero or more characters enclosed within double quotes is a string literal.
* The type of string literal is an array of constant chars.
* The compiler appends the character '\0' to every string literal. Thus size of a string literal is one more than the apparent size.
* Two string literals that appear adjacent to one another and that are separated only by spaces, tabs, or newlines are concatenated into a single literal.


*We can override the default type of literal by using prefixes and suffixes.*

**Boolean Literals**

The words true and false are boolean literals.

**Pointer Literals**

The word nullptr is a pointer literal.

## Variables

Variable is a named storage that our program can manipulate. Each variable in C++ has a type. The type determines the size and layout of the variable's memory, the range of values that can be stored in that memory and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
